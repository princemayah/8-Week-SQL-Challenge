# 8-Week-SQL-Challenge
The 8-Week SQL Challenge is a comprehensive learning program designed to enhance SQL skills through real-world case studies. Each case study focuses on a different scenario and provides a dataset that simulates real-world data. The case studies are designed to progressively increase in complexity, starting with simpler scenarios that focus on foundational SQL concepts and gradually introduce more advanced techniques and concepts. This repository contains the solutions for all eight case studies included in the challenge.

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## 🍕 Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/princemayah/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="Images/Pizza%20Runner.png" align="center" width="300">

Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## 🥑 Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/princemayah/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%233%20-%20Foodie-Fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="Images/Foodie-Fi.png" align="center" width="300">

Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## 📊 Case Study #4 - Data Bank
<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/princemayah/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%234%20-%20Data%20Bank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="Images/Data%20Bank.png" align="center" width="300">

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

Data Mart is Danny’s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

The key business question he wants you to help him answer are the following:

- What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
- Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
- What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?
